# Budgeter by Oliver Matheus

The Budgeter is a personal project I've started in order to learn more about what I can accomplish developing software.

## Features:
- [x] Open budgets from a JSON/CSV file
- [ ] Save budgets to a JSON/CSV file
- [ ] Log money either into total or into a certain split [^1]
- [ ] Sort splits cards[^2] by percentage, money, & alphabetically
- [ ] App themes

#### Footnotes
[^1]: "Split" refers to a dedicated percentage of the budget that only goes to a certain cause (e.g. Savings, Expenses). 
  The user can name splits as well as have a value set for how much money they contain
[^2]: "Split Cards" are just frames that contain info about a split. They will also serve as buttons for further functionality.
